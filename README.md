## Bio

I'm **Terje Kvernes**, a systems administrator, software developer, generalized hacker, and writer. I work with Linux (mostly RHEL), MacOS, NetApp, Cisco, APC infrastructure and a lot of other hardware. I'm sadly also known to be working with audio-visual equipment (mostly Crestron based, but less so recently) and performing Zoom management.

My toolchest at work includes stuff like:
 - Ansible
 - CFEngine
 - Fleet/OSquery
 - terraform (and a bit of Packer, targeting AWS, Azure, and OpenStack)
 - python
 - perl (yes, really)
 - the (more than) occasional shell script
 - monitoring through Zabbix/Grafana/Prometheus (and Nagios for some reason)
 - and whatever else the job throws at me... I also have done work in Go, C, Fortran... 

In my spare time I hike, write fiction, and get fascinated by new and novel ideas.

## Projects

Sadly, most of my time is spent on work-related projects that rarely make it to github.
### Work-adjacent projects

* [mreg](https://github.com/unioslo/mreg) and [mreg-cli](https://github.com/unioslo/mreg-cli): A DNS management system and its command line interface. Written specifically for the University of Oslo, but with some promise of being useful to others.
  * I wrangle stuff.
* [EESSI](https://github.com/EESSI/): European Environment for Scientific Software Installations
  * I mostly deal with AWS infrastructure trough terraform and ansible, and otherwise try to be helpful. Sadly not nearly as active as I'd like to be.
* [NESSI](https://github.com/NorESSI/): Norwegian offshoot from EESSI
  * A bit more active, but still not as much as I'd like. :cry:

### Personal projects

* [hubuum](https://github.com/terjekv/hubuum): A non-opinionated CMDB.
  * This may become more than slightly work adjacent, but right now it's a personal project.
* [terraform-aws-ami-search](https://github.com/terjekv/terraform-aws-ami-search): Find the most recent AWS AMI for a specific linux distribution, optionally filtered by version and architecture. It's available from [terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/terjekv/ami-search/latest).

### Other projects

* [github-authorized-keys](https://github.com/terjekv/github-authorized-keys): Using teams on github to manage ssh authorized keys.
  * Planned to use with EESSI/NESSI.
* [github-authorized-keys](https://github.com/terjekv/github-authorized-keys): Using teams on github to manage ssh authorized keys.
  * Planned to use with EESSI/NESSI.
* [eessi/status-page](https://github.com/EESSI/status-page): A [status page](http://status.eessi-infra.org) for EESSI service delivery.
  * This isn't the prettiest solution, but it works. 
* [cvmfs-server-scraper](https://github.com/terjekv/cvmfs-server-scraper): A python tool to scrape [cvmfs](https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs) server status.
  * Used to create the [status page](http://status.eessi-infra.org) above.

I also contribute to the [Easybuild](https://easybuild.io) project, mostly via easyconfigs.


### Other stuff

#### Talks and presentations

* ARM HPC Users group 2020: [EasyBuild on ARM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyR-STGRnfM). Experiences in running EasyBuild on ARM, going through some of the issues with porting software reliant on SSE intrinsics and how to get around such issues.
